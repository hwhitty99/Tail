Chapter 5 - Pointers and Arrays

Write a program tail -n number which prints the last number lines of input from stdin. For example: tail -n 15 prints the last 15 lines.
The -n command line argument is optional, by default tail prints the last 10 lines.
The program should behave rationally no matter how unreasonable the input from stdin is or the value of n.
Write the program so it makes efficient use of storage.
You should use calloc(), malloc(), realloc and free() to allocate and release memory for the storage of lines from stdin.
